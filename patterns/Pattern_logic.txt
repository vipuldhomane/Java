: first start with breaking down the pattern in the matrix form.
: find out the rows and columns.
: for row inner loop logic will be used which means i will be used.
: for row outer loop logic will be used which means j will be used.

for number of rows write the outer loop then for number of columns 
write the inner loop *most importantly dont use ln in print in inner loop*
